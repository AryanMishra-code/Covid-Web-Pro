        It is a communicable disease that has evolved from animals like bats, snakes, rats and scorpions. This virus, starting from China, has
        effected 159 countries worldwide. More than 170,000 positive cases are reported, including our own country India, which is reported to be more than 300 Covid-19 cases in less than a month.

   <font size = 5px> <h1><b>The symptoms of most coronaviruses are similar to any other upper respiratory infection, including runny nose, coughing, sore throat, and sometimes a fever. In most cases, you won't know whether you have a coronavirus or a different cold-causing virus, such as rhinovirus.
<br>
<br>
        You could get lab tests, including nose and throat cultures and blood work, to find out whether your cold was caused by a coronavirus, but there's no reason to. The test results wouldn't change how you treat your symptoms, which typically go away in a few days.
        <br>
        <br>
        But if a coronavirus infection spreads to the lower respiratory tract (your windpipe and your lungs), it can cause pneumonia, especially in older people, people with heart disease, or people with weakened immune systems.

<br>
<br>
       > Wash your hands thoroughly with soap and warm water or with an alcohol-based hand sanitizer.<br>
       > Keep your hands and fingers away from your eyes, nose, and mouth.<br>
       > Avoid close contact with people who are infected.<br>
        <br>
        You treat a coronavirus infection the same way you treat a cold:
        <br> 
        
       >Get plenty of rest.<br>
       >Drink fluids.<br>
       >Take over-the-counter medicine for a sore throat and fever. But don't give aspirin to children or teens younger than 19; use ibuprofen or acetaminophen instead.<br>
       >A humidifier or steamy shower can also help ease a sore and scratchy throat.<br>
        <br>
        Even when a coronavirus causes MERS or SARS in other countries, the kind of coronavirus infection common in the U.S. isn't a serious threat for an otherwise healthy adult. If you get sick, treat your symptoms and contact a doctor if they get worse or don't go away.</b></h1></font>
